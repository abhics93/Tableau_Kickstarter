# You need a kickstart!

Kickstarter is a crowd-funding heaven for promoting creativity and merchandizing across the world. A company based in Brooklyn, USA has so far been able to fund more than 2 Million projects! Today we shall explore a beautiful dataset about this company, posted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects)

The dataset consists of 378,661 rows and 15 different variables. 
 
North America has the highest number of projects followed by a far second, Great Britain. Most pledges are hence made In US Dollars.

Let us look into the categories that are present for these projects. From the graph below we see that projects in Kickstarter are majorly the creative type (Film and Video, Music, Publishing, Games, etc.)

Upon selecting (clicking) on a category, the visualization displays sub-categories within the selection. Below we have sub-categories in the main category Comics. The ‘state’ variable shows whether the project has been successful, failed, cancelled, is live, suspended or undefined. By grouping, we use three main categories of projects as shown below…

The three visualizations above are combined to form a dashboard using Tableau and is converted to an interactive format.

If you had a project idea to pitch, what category does it fall in and how likely is your project to fail? 
‘What are the chances you will fail?’

The above visualization shows categories that are hardest to succeed in and also the ones in which it is observed to be not too difficult for various reasons (that are not explored in this visualization or dataset). 

In order to learn from the best, I made a graph showing the top few projects that have gained the most pledges in Kickstarter in recent years. The labels on the line show what category the project belongs to. The color shows how many backers have backed that particular project. 

Conclusion: The visualization aids in gaining a broad view about Kickstarter in general. If one were to consider posting his/her project on this platform, one could make use of this visualization in order gain a picture of how different categories fare in the crowdfunding market.
